**Client Brief: Novel Platform Migration to Next.js**

---

**Project Overview:**
I run "StoryWeaver" - a platform where readers can collaboratively influence ongoing novels. Authors publish chapters in real-time, and readers vote on plot directions, character decisions, and story branches. Think interactive fiction meets social media.

**Current Tech Stack Issues:**
My current site is built on a janky WordPress setup with custom plugins that keep breaking. The user experience is terrible, and I'm losing engagement. I need a modern, fast platform that can handle real-time interactions.

**What I Need You to Build:**

**Core Features:**

1. **Author Dashboard** - Upload chapters, create decision points, view analytics
2. **Reader Interface** - Read chapters, vote on decisions, comment, follow stories
3. **Real-time Voting System** - Live polls for story decisions with countdown timers
4. **Story Branching** - Handle multiple story paths based on vote outcomes
5. **User Profiles** - Reader stats, favorite genres, voting history
6. **Notification System** - New chapters, voting deadlines, story updates

**Technical Requirements:**

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Supabase for database and auth
- Real-time subscriptions for voting
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- SEO optimization for story discovery
- Image upload for chapter illustrations

**Your Development Priorities:**

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1-2):** Set up Next.js project, Supabase integration, authentication
2. **Phase 2 (Week 3-4):** Build story reading interface and basic voting system
3. **Phase 3 (Week 5-6):** Author dashboard and chapter management
4. **Phase 4 (Week 7-8):** Real-time features and notifications

**Key Business Requirements:**

- Voting must be secure (one vote per user per decision)
- Stories need to be easily discoverable via search/genres
- Mobile experience is crucial (60% of my users are on mobile)
- Need analytics for authors (engagement, voting patterns, reader demographics)

**Budget & Timeline:**
I need this launched in 8 weeks. I'm paying good money for this, so I expect clean, maintainable code with proper error handling. Don't cut corners on security or performance.

**Questions for You:**

1. How will you handle the real-time voting updates?
2. What's your approach for the story branching logic?
3. How will you optimize for SEO so stories get discovered?

I'm excited to see what you can build! This could be the next big thing in interactive storytelling.
